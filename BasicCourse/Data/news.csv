1,"More than 100 healthy babies have been born to mothers infected with the novel coronavirus in one hospital in India's western city of Mumbai.

Three of the 115 babies born to infected mothers at the Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital in the past month initially tested positive for Covid-19, but subsequent tests cleared them, doctors said.

Two other infected pregnant women died at the hospital, including one who died before her baby was born.

With nearly 24,000 reported infections and more than 840 deaths so far, India's financial and entertainment capital has become the epicentre of Covid-19.

More than half of the babies born to infected women at the hospital - also called Sion Hospital - were delivered through C-section, while the rest were natural births, officials said. Fifty-six of them were boys, while 59 were girls. Twenty-two of these infected mothers were referred to from other hospitals: it is not clear whether the majority of these women contracted the infection at home, outdoors or in a hospital ward.

A team of 65 doctors and two dozen nurses have been treating these Covid-infected mothers in a 40-bed special ward. With the surge of infections, the hospital is planning to add another 34 beds for infected pregnant patients.

The deliveries are happening on half a dozen tables in three operation theatres where doctors, and nurses and anaesthetists are using protective gear."
2,"Police have arrested a man suspected of killing two young women in Pakistan, after a video in which a man is seen kissing them went viral on social media.

Muhammad Aslam is suspected of shooting the pair, aged 18 and 16, who were his cousins.

The man in the video, the owner of the phone it was filmed on, and relatives of the women are also in custody.

Rights group say violence against women remains a serious problem in Pakistan.

They were murdered last week in the village of Shamplan, in Garyom region on the border of North and South Waziristan tribal districts in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province.

The area is a socially conservative remote region, where tribal law is often upheld over federal law.

Activists believe about 1,000 such so-called ""honour killing"" murders - for perceived transgressions of social codes - are carried out across the country every year."
3,"Cyclone Amphan made landfall in eastern India and Bangladesh on Wednesday, killing at least 15 people as it lashed coastal areas with ferocious wind and rain.

Many of Kolkata's 14 million people are without electricity and communications have been disrupted.

West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said the devastation was ""a bigger disaster than Covid-19"".

Kolkata is the capital of West Bengal state which has seen 3,103 confirmed cases of the infection.

""Area after area has been ruined. I have experienced a war-like situation today,"" Ms Banerjee was quoted as saying by the Press Trust of India news agency."
4,"The coronavirus outbreak and lockdown conditions have brought mixed fortunes to online-dating platforms like Tinder, according to its chief executive Elie Seidman.

On the one hand, user engagement is up, a trend other dating apps have reported too.

Tinder users made 3 billion swipes worldwide on Sunday 29 March, the most the app has ever recorded in a single day. In the UK, daily conversations rose by 12% between mid-February and the end of March.

There has been a ""dramatic shift"" in behaviour metrics which are normally stable, says Mr Seidman.

However, the economic impact of lockdown means people have less money to spend.

This is not such good news for Tinder, which is free but relies on premium subscriptions for its revenue.

：The [US] unemployment figures are hard to see,； says Mr Seidman. ：I・m very concerned about what happens economically for our society and the impact it will have on so many of our members.""

Tinder has been downloaded more than 340 million times since its launch in 2012. But the vast majority of its revenues come from just 6 million subscribers who pay for the ""gold"" service. The rate at which it picked up those precious paying-users declined as lockdown struck.

The company・s data show that new sign-ups for premium membership pick up where lockdowns start to ease, says Mr Siedman.

：You can literally see the comeback on a state by state basis [in the US], as things come out and start to loosen up, as the peak crisis starts to pass.；

Other platforms which offer free sign-up have noticed something similar during lockdown."
5,"Nasa astronauts Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken have arrived at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida to prepare for their historic mission next week.

The pair's flight to the International Space Station (ISS) will be made in a rocket and capsule system provided by a commercial company, SpaceX.

Nasa has traditionally always owned and operated its space vehicles.

But that is a capability it gave up in 2011 when it retired the last of the space shuttles.

The agency now intends to contract out all future crew transportation to low-Earth orbit.

Hurley and Behnken flew into Florida from the agency's human spaceflight headquarters in Texas where they have been in quarantine.

They'll continue protecting their health at Kennedy as they get ready for Wednesday's planned lift-off."
